        Hi, my name is Achyutha and I'm a programmer. I am currently pursuing master’s degree in computer science at Arizona State University. I am passionate about learning. I've learned various languages and frameworks and built more to-do lists then I can count. Before my master’s degree, I worked as ASP .NET Full-stack web developer for 3+ years at VMware, Inc. Bangalore, and did my Summer Internship for the same role at VMware, Inc. Atlanta. During my master’s degree, I've also worked as a tutor for advanced c# programming class. It's always gratifying to help and teach people as well as partaking in a rabbit hole with students because everyone asks different questions that would never occur to me.
